# Jump Scares in Horror, Thriller, and Sci-Fi Movies
# r/dataisbeautiful's DataViz Battle for October 2019

## Backgroud
For October 2019 Reddit's r/dataisbeautiful's DataViz Battle deals with Jump Scares in horror, thriller, and sci-fi movies. 

## Data Collection
This month it was a simple task to copy the dataset into a csv file. It's only 543 entries. Simple copy/paste. Nothing like [September 2019's](https://github.com/Agrattendick/DataVizCommentScoresSeptember2019) dataset.

## Data Analysis
There appear to be a few ways to view the data. Comparing the Jump Count and/or Jump Scare Rating to the IMDB rating, looking at Jump Count and/or Jump Scare Rating changes over the years, and possibly examining the Directors to see if any show up again and again. 

No numbers, but based off quick observations there appears to be a weak negative correlation between Imdb scores and Jump Count, Imdb and Jump Scare rating needs some more analysis but any connection appears unlikely. Jump Count and Jump Scare index does have a moderately strong positive correlation, but that's not surprising that both come from the same source.

Using the data to map the popularity of Jump Scare movies seems the best option. Looking at the percent of movies in a given year that Where's the Jump considers Jump Scare movies given all movies produced that year from The Numbers.
